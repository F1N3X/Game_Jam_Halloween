# Why this project ?

As a web developer in a video game association organizing a game jam for last halloween, some of my friends and I said "why not make a JS game?".

We created a story and imagined 3 different mini-games that each member of the team had to develop

## Here is my part :

Meet Oogie Boogie and run away from him in a labyrinth using yourse mouse.


### If you want to win

**Do not touche the walls** if you don't want to get catch.

**Find the door** at the end to definitely escape and pass to the next room.
